# Extracting the constants needed for a packet certificate

The [packet estimate](axis-packet-bound.md) requires a spacetime tube where
the actual assembled field equals its smooth base, a tube radius rho, and a
uniform spatial Hessian bound M. This audit identifies which source results
supply existence and which data still lack numerical certificates.

Source inspection uses OpenAI commit
`f9e8bc5b38b6e212696e8a30e3e91517af887bbd`; the added extension lemmas are
also checked against the original pin. No coefficient values or ODE trajectory
were sampled to infer the bounds.

The current source-bound extension reports record the checks of the stated
lemmas against both pins. These are checks of identities and the acceptance
path, not numerical extraction.

## A uniform derivative bound can be transferred

`SlowBorelBase.compact_jet_bound` gives, for a smooth function on an open
domain and any compact subset K, a uniform bound for each prescribed
iterated derivative order. `FinalSlowBase.velocity_smooth` supplies smoothness
on `BaseResidual.past`, the open spacetime domain t<1.

The extension `compact_jet_bound_from_selected_base_germs` now joins those
facts to neighborhood equality: if the assembled velocity agrees locally
with that selected base at every point of compact K contained in t<1, then

    exists M >= 1, for every w in K: ||D^m u(w)|| <= M.

This is a uniform bound over K, not separate unrelated constants at its
points. Its hypothesis is neighborhood equality throughout K. Equality on
the axis alone would not supply a bound on a tube. The classical open-union
and compact-tube construction in the flow note supplies such a K existentially.

At m=2 the formal statement concerns the full spacetime derivative. Restrict
each argument to a spatial vector through the linear embedding v -> (0,v).
This embedding has norm one for the source product norm, so the same bound
controls the spatial Hessian. This restriction argument is classical here;
the new Lean lemma does not separately formalize that last composition.

## Finite-stage cutoff with a known chart lower bound

There is also a useful finite reduction. Suppose q_chart>=qmin>0 throughout
a proposed compact tube, and the natural-valued cutoff schedule a is strictly
increasing. Then a(j)>=j. Choose a natural J with J*qmin>1. For every j>=J,

    a(j)*q_chart >= j*qmin >= J*qmin > 1.

`SlowBorelBase.powerStage_jet_zero` then makes every derivative order of
that cutoff stage zero. The new extension lemma
`cutoff_stage_jets_zero_above_index` checks this implication for arbitrary
scalar coefficients, exponents and derivative orders.

The subsequent extension now checks the complete scalar finite-sum replacement:
`slowSum_eq_cutPrefix_of_index` identifies `slowSum` with `cutPrefix` whenever
q_chart>0 and J*q_chart>1. The source `cutPrefix J` includes indices 0 through
J; its index-J term is zero under this condition. The leading profile is
retained separately. No uncut prefix is substituted for the cutoff prefix.

`slowSum_eventuallyEq_cutPrefix_of_index` establishes equality on a common
neighborhood, and `slowSum_jet_eq_cutPrefix_of_index` transfers all derivative
orders. No coefficient regularity premise is needed for these locality
identities; using the resulting derivatives as classical smooth derivatives
still requires the existing smoothness facts. Finally,
`physicalProfile_eventuallyEq_cutPrefix_of_index` retains neighborhood equality
after the physical-chart composition and multiplication by its q-power.

A valid qmin must bound the chart coordinate on the **whole tube**. Substituting
its value only on the axis would leave a gap. Equality for the scalar physical
profiles is not yet an executable finite formula for the complete assembled
velocity with every primitive, spatial curl and profile parameter extracted.

This reduction avoids estimating an infinite tail on a compact interval away
from t=1. It does not make the remaining coefficient functions or cutoff
scales numerically available by itself.

## Why this is not yet a numerical packet certificate

| Input | Inspected source evidence | Missing numerical content |
|---|---|---|
| Profile and modulation | `FinalSlowBase.actualProfile` uses `Classical.choice profileData_nonempty` | An executable representative or certified enclosures for the selected coefficient functions |
| Base cutoff scales | `EntranceAlignedBase.scales` uses `Classical.choose exists_admissibleScales`; `FinalSlowBase.scales_spec` retains admissibility | Values or upper/lower interval certificates for the finite active scales |
| Template derivative bound | `SlowBorelBase.exists_template_jet_bound` takes a compact continuous-derivative bound | A computed enclosure for that compact maximum |
| Physical tube | Terminal base-germ transfer and compactness give a neighborhood | Explicit radius and chart-coordinate lower bound valid throughout it |
| Finite-prefix Hessian | Finitely many smooth terms and chart derivatives | Certified derivative enclosures after composition and multiplication |

The existing `exists_cartesian_profile_tail` theorem is another possible
route, but its J, delta and C are existential and depend on admissible scales
and compact chart-derivative bounds. It is not an already available numerical
Hessian constant. Likewise the stress-weighted estimates cannot be substituted
for a velocity Hessian estimate without proving the relevant derivative link.

These are limits of the extracted evidence, not a theorem that numerical
realization is impossible. A future certificate can provide rho, qmin, the
finite active data and derivative enclosures, then use the explicit packet
inequality. The existence/transfer, stage-vanishing and scalar finite-prefix
locality steps are formalized. No particular finite packet is certified, and no pressure
condition or material-viscosity conclusion follows from these bounds.
