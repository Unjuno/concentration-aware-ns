# Goal — revision 2, 2026-09-09

Build a reproducible Concentration-Aware Navier–Stokes Verification Benchmark.
Treat the supplied proposal as hypotheses. Verify primary sources, repository
revisions, licenses and execution environments before interpreting experiments.

1. Establish one dedicated repository, a preregistered protocol and reusable
   evidence collection/reporting tools.
2. Implement a smooth, localized 3D incompressible manufactured solution with
   known forcing. Independently verify reference values, forcing and derivatives.
3. Execute OpenFOAM first, then independent SU2 and PhysicsNeMo evaluations.
   Compare at least three spatial resolutions and multiple applicable time steps.
   Record standard convergence/validation, local gradient and vorticity peaks,
   spectra and applicable AMR constraints. Separate hypothesis reproduction from
   numerical quality acceptance.
4. Classify broad audit candidates by evidence and cause. Record fixed commits,
   environments, inputs, thresholds, raw logs, uncertainty and reproduction steps.
5. Complete one audit pass over all three projects. Search existing issues and
   inspect contribution policies. Report only reproducible, nonduplicate findings
   with concrete improvements through appropriate issues or PRs. Preserve report
   URLs or justified decisions not to submit.
6. Publish reproducible artifacts and per-project conclusions with remaining
   limitations. Completion requires actual evidence for all steps above; a passing
   checker or synthetic demonstration is not evidence of a solver defect.

Do not infer blow-up, singularities or engineering danger from numerical error.
An unverified purported OpenAI construction is not an assumption of this work.

## Execution authorization and revisions

The user subsequently authorized creation of this repository and operational
progress. Repository creation is no longer held for the initial review stage.
Upstream submissions remain conditional on the evidence requirements above.
Document new findings and changes of implementation plan here through commits;
do not quietly reduce the three-project scope or redefine completion.

This file versions the operational goal. The desktop goal text is separately
managed by the app; editing this file does not change the app's saved goal.

## Expanded scope authorized 2026-09-09

The user explicitly authorized starting work, upstream GitHub issues and related
technical discussion. Create exactly one project repository. Extend the impact
inventory to relevant numerical analysis, Scientific ML and fluid control claims;
record searched scope and unassessed areas instead of claiming universal coverage.
Develop the analytic reference problem and publish reproducible technical methods
as defensive disclosure. Adversarial evaluation means trying to falsify the
benchmark's claims and testing counterexamples, not treating projects as guilty.
The ambiguous phrase concerning analytical work is operationalized as deriving
and checking this manufactured solution, not promising to solve open regularity
problems. A paper/construction beyond the supplied proposal needs an identifiable
primary source before it can support a claim of a new discovery.

## Revision 3 — source located

The user pointed to OpenAI's repository. It is now identified and pinned in
`docs/openai-source.md`. Audit its actual definitions and constructive witness
before transferring the discovery to numerical impact claims. The existing MMS
is a calibration problem, not a substitute for auditing that construction.
